# KNOW Ontology

KNOW–the _Knowledge Navigator Ontology for the World_–is an [ontology]
designed to capture everyday knowledge to augment large language models
(LLMs) in real-world use cases such as personal AI assistants.

Our domain is human life, both its everyday concerns and its major milestones.
We have limited the initial scope of the modeled concepts to only established
human universals: spacetime ([places], [events]) plus social ([people],
[groups], [organizations]). The inclusion criteria for modeled concepts are
pragmatic, beginning with universality and utility.

We also make available code-generated [software development kits] for the 12
most popular programming languages, enabling the direct use of ontology
concepts in software design and engineering.
